# Amazon SageMaker tutorial

This is an Amazon SageMaker tutorial for easily training and deploying ML models, based on work done during a 3days internship at AWS Japan, in collaboration with [@uidilr](https://github.com/uidilr). We've also written an article in Japanese [here](https://qiita.com/ku2482/items/af187b427d941dee7ca0), which you can refer to.

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

## Usage

To train and deploy an example of ML models, see [deploy_example.ipynb](https://github.com/ku2482/sagemaker-tutorial/blob/master/deploy_example.ipynb).
